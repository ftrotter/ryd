<h1> Sharing Warning </h1>
<h2> You might have seen this before but... </h2>

<p>
When you share your recordings with someone, they can "borrow" them and maintain permanent access. Anytime you like, you can stop {$print_url} from sharing with a particular user, or you can stop sharing with everyone all at once.... this will instantly prevent another user from using {$print_url} to access your recordings. But it is important to remember that once you share with someone, they could potentially keep a local copy of your recording. There is no good way for {$print_url} to stop this, because in the worst case... a person could just hold a tape recorder up to the computer as they play back message that you have shared with them. We have not thought of a good way to stop that kind of rudeness, but if we do... we will let you know. </p>
<p>If this idea makes you uncomfortable, then perhaps the {$print_url} sharing function is not for you. Do not worry, you can still let people listen to your recordings by allowing them to be with you when you play them back (using the play phone number or the web interface)... but if you do not like the idea of someone you shared with having permanent access, the best way is not to share with them through {$print_url} </p>
<p>
Alternatively, if you have people in your life that you trust completely, and you are certain that they would never do anything to hurt or betray you, then you can trust the {$print_url} sharing system to share with them and just them, securely. Please use the <a href='{$feedback_url}'>feedback link</a> to ask any questions about how the sharing works, or to comment on how we can make it better. 
</p>
<p> Otherwise, you were on your way somewhere, and we interrupted you to give you this warning, which you may have seen before... perhaps you would like to <a href='javascript:history.back()'>go back</a> and continue on your way..
