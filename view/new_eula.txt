If you have elected to grant access to others, Patient Always First makes no guarantee regarding the (i) integrity of your health information, and (ii) professional standing of anyone to whom you have granted access.  
6.SECURITY
This Website uses Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) for secure transmission.  However, due to the nature of the Internet and the ability of the Member to allow others to access the Member’s health information, Patient Always First makes no representation or warranties about the security and integrity of the health information stored on the Website.  It is the User’s responsibility to keep the username, password or other access information safe and confidential to protect against unauthorized access to the Website.  It is the Users responsibility to (i) select a unique username and password for the User’s Google “Gmail” account, which are used to access voice recordings created by User that are maintained on the Website, (ii) take all appropriate actions to maintain the confidentiality of and prevent the unauthorized use of the username and password, and (iii) immediately notify Patient Always First in writing if the User has reason to believe that an unauthorized party has gained access to the username or password of any User.

The use of the assigned username or password of any User shall be the sole responsibility of the User and Patient Always First will not be responsible for any damages to the Member relating to any use, misuse or unauthorized use of the Member’s username or password. 
This Website also collects certain information.  For example, this Website will retain a Members’ or User’s name, email address and Open ID URL, which may be obtained either directly from the Member or User or from Google as a part of the login/verification process.  The retained email address may be used to send notices to a Member of User or their next of kin.  Such notices may include but are not limited to notices pertaining to upgrades, special offers and, if deemed appropriate by Patient Always First, next-of-kin information.  Further, this website may collect next-of-kin addresses, either electronic mail or physical addresses, for the purposes of providing such notices.  This Website may also collect Member’s telephone numbers in order to identify incoming calls.  
This Website uses “Cookies,” which are pieces of data stored on a Member’s or a User’s hard drive containing information relating to the Member’s or User’s visit(s) to the Website.  The use of “cookies” is in no way linked to any of Member’s or User’s personally identifiable information.   Cookies are used by the Website to facilitate its operation.  Cookies are not used by the Website for any other purpose, and no information related thereto will be made available to a third party.
This Website works with and cooperates with certain vendors in order to perform the voice recording and playback services provided.  For example, this Website cooperates with a telephony applications service provider (“Telephony App Provider”) that facilitates provision of the services.  The Telephony App Provider communicates with the Website, Yourdoctorsadvice.org, by means of a unique URL that is secure and private to Patient First Always.  The Telephony App Provider, and its cloud communications provider, have momentary access to unencrypted data recorded through the Website.  However, promptly after the unencrypted data is provided to the Website via this URL, the data is encrypted by the Website  and deleted by Telephony App Provider, leaving the recorded and encrypted data  stored only in a system managed by the Website.  The Telephony App Provider, its cloud communications provider and other third party vendors may have access to the encrypted data files but no authorization to open same.  The Website will provide authorized access to unencrypted files to the Member and other individuals to whom the Member grants access by disclosing the Member’s username and password.  The Website also will provide access to authorized unencrypted files to other entities as required by law.  The Website provider is committed to protecting the privacy and confidentiality of Member and User content, and commercially reasonable practices are being employed to insure such privacy and confidentiality.  By acceptance of these terms and conditions, or by use of this Website, you expressly agree that Patient Always First and the Website provider have implemented procedures and practices that are commercially reasonable to maintain the security of all data and the Member’s or User’s personal information. 
This Website may occasionally update this security statement as new best practices are implemented in regards to security.  Patient Always First therefore encourages periodic review of this statement so that its Members and Users can remain informed regarding steps taken and practices implemented to protect information and maintain security.  
7.LINKS

After the 30 days period, Patient Always First may destroy the health information and will not be liable for any lost records.  Member acknowledges that, upon termination, Member has created and will retain a back-up or duplicate of all patient health information.
Except for the termination under Section 4, where the termination may occur immediately, Patient Always First reserves the right to terminate any User’s access to the Website, for any reason, provided that Patient Always First provides the User with a 30-day advance notification.

The arbitration may be initiated by either party by written notice specifying the Claims to be arbitrated.

The parties will provide each other with production of all requested documents and records reasonably related to the dispute in a manner that will minimize the expense and inconvenience of both parties.  Further discovery will be as the arbitrators expressly allow on a showing of need.  All arbitrator’s orders and decisions may be enforceable in, and judgment upon any award rendered in the arbitration proceeding may be confirmed and entered by, any federal or state court of competent jurisdiction.  All proceedings shall be conducted in English and, unless otherwise set forth in these Terms and Conditions, shall take place in Houston, Texas. 
The arbitration conducted pursuant hereto shall be decided by a single arbitrator appointed in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Rules.
