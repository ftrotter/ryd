Notes to self... 
Release 1 required features

	- Add pin code support to playing patient messages using the telephone
	- Add "sharing warning" somewhere in the system
	- Have recordings have static numbers, so that users can "remember" what recording they want to play on the phone interface. 
        - Make the above work on numbers that count on a per-user basis
     	- Control for abusing users. how do we stop people from stealing hosting.
	- Figure out why the subcribe to error is happening on the manage sharing page.
	- create a help links system that allow for video embedding on smart browsers,
		and just displays a help page on ie6
	- On the per recording menu, make a drop down called "advanced" and make it hide the functions as per pidoco
      	- After there are 5 or 6 shared with on a given record, create a more button to hide the list of other people the record is shared with... reuse the menu css? not likely... how else to do this?
		How to degrade this on IE6?




For iphone/ipad
	- Allow stop all sharing from the sharing menu
	- Display who you are sharing with and allow stop sharing on a per user basis too.	




Tidy up
	- Fix snap to top on rename. 
		perhaps by moving to fieldset on the display. mabye using
		http://www.tyssendesign.com.au/examples/styling-legends-revised.html#ex-one

	- figure out why the firewall is interfering with rackspace cloud applications and turn it back on!!.. 
		it completely locked me out once too... what gives?
	- How to handle invite vs deleted sharing.
		if you delete sharing with someone that you invited then it detects that you invited them and allows you to add them back
		which is great... if you want to
		but if you did not invite someone to the service and you stop sharing, it is gone forever
		one solution is to create a "invite" record when adding a current user
		which would effectively give you a "history" if you stopped all sharing.. but is that dangerous?
		
	- Do I need to allow deleting of invitations? to get rid of history?
	- what about an invitation to view just one record? right now if a person is not in the system
		then when the inviation is accepted you are queried to add them to -all- of your recordings

Sharing Redesign, 
?	It is unclear when you have an invited accepted (and therefore a share with button) AND you can invite new people, it looks like
		its all part of the same process. 
?	Make the invited user has joined an annoucement at the end of the login process...
		You should be able to stop and start future sharing, and start and stop current sharing all using checkboxes. 
?        Also when you "stop sharing" with someone entirely you they need to move to a "trash" area, where they can be permenatly deleted.

Multi-tab auto-logout.
	Fatal error: Call to undefined method Controller_login::manage() in /var/www/html/record/public/index.php on line 108 	
	this happens because you have more than one tab open and the timeout hits in another tab...
Release 2 required features


	- for ipad/iphone Determine how to play an audio file from a web_app (i.e. a bookmark clickable from the homepage) 

	- for pages that have only have required form inputs, set the focus on the input using onload javascript
		so that when a user starts typing it automatically goes into the right place.

        - Ask your doctor reminders
		have a printable list of things that you might want to ask your doctor about.
		it would be nice if this was something that you could build while you played back your recordings.
		how to make this responsive (ajax) but still accessible (not ajax) 

	- Appointment reminders
		Add a date to recieve a call so that the system can remind you to ask your doctor something, and to remind you to record
		your doctor when you visit them...


	?? Create a "share with your doctor" feature 
		- doctors can sign up by verifying their npi (done through healers oath) 
		- doctors still use gmail to login... but that is not how their users find them, they use a doctor search function instead.
		- doctors can see all of "thier" patients... but do not have a capacity for their own recordings

	- Prevent new recordings from the phone system after subscription expires
		- play a warning message to users 2 months before subscription expires
	- fully seperate controller and view (no html in controllers) so that you can:
		- create an iphone interface
		- support multiple languanges starting with spanish
	- upload file progress bar
	- mark shared accounts as spam.
	- on the sharing page, distingish between "share all" and "share some"
		The report should start with those users that you are sharing all with. Then it should show any user that you are just sharing a few files with
		and detail what recordings exactly you are sharing. 
	- comments
		- New plan hire Josh (or someonelike), or do myself to do an open source mp3 player that supports the new Cue Point system in OSMF
			http://blogs.adobe.com/osmf/2009/11/cue_point_support_in_osmf.html
		The system should generously support "moment in time" commenting inside the mp3 file
		so that you could make a comment about an mp3 file and include cue points inside the comments.
		you would want to make all comments available for display, and clicking on the cue points would move the stream to the right place
		you would want comments to "focus" when the player naturally crossed that part of the mp3 file.
		the player should support javascript integration so that you could control using hyper links, just like niftyplayer...
		this will make it accessible even if the flash is not accessible...
		this should spawn a seperate open source mp3 player project. see if josh would run it...
		this should wait for OSMF 1.0 
	- tags
	- full delete recordings - system should inlcude a basic "trash" feature by adding a "deleted" data point to recordings..
		and a delete date. So that recordings will be really deleted after about a month or so. these files should listed in the 
		new "trash" area. If users browse to the trash list, they can both restore and permenantly delete recordings
	- API
		new API plan: There does not need to be a new "layer" of sharing. Rather each user can share recordings with any other user...
		The decryption keys for incoming recordings will be recorded by the -owner- public key AND any user with a user_user_access entry with a 
		valid signature. So to share an indivdual record, you can share it by directly encoding it with the public key of that user.
		or you can "share all" which will do an indivual share on all previous recordings, then create an entry in user_user_access and sign it
		when new recordings come in, the encrypting process will search for valid signed user_user_access entries and encrypt with 
		that users public key if it is valid
		Any user can create a token that can be later used in the API as a proxy for their private key. So if a doctor wants to integrate his/her EHR
		then he signs up with his practice email, and then encourages his patients to share records with him. 
		His EHR software can accept tokens for his account, and then download shared recordings that his account has access to, via users email.
		Or he can just login with the email and he will see his hundreds of records right there... So integration is really a user-centric issue.
		each phone is essentially a secondary user_key for a given user. The phone numbers are no longer recorded directly into the database for this
		reason and instead only a hash is stored. The plaintext phone number is in fact the key. Of course this is a highly crackable user_key.
		As a result we need to allow the user the option to decide to disable the "key with the phone" for thier account. Although this will mean that 
		the playback phone number will no longer work for them, since merely calling with thier phone will no longer grant them access to their private key,
		which will not allow the mp3s to be decoded.
		There can now be a "trust RYD admins with a backup of your recordings" setting which is essentially a default setting for a user...

	- openid proxy
	- mp3 tagging to detect download/upload sharing transition

Implement:

*on demand storage
*	get rackspace storage working

*phone calls
*	get basic twilio integration working with test number
*	rent 1800 number


* Rename recording title:
(stubbed) Delete Recordings: (depends on rackspace files) 
Comment system:
	tagging
	different user commenting on recordings
	recording owner or comment owner delete.

* recording uploads
(later)	get some kind of "working do not click anything... signal"


(later) Launch OpenID Directed Identity provider

meta-sharing
	use second level to implement token/password/directed_id
	create second level public key access system

recording sharing
*	for one recording
	for all of your recordings (depends on meta sharing)
	sharing with non-users (depends on meta sharing)
		Must have some method for sending a "code" that gives access to a users normal email account
		then linking that account to an OpenID of the right kind...
		
Account: manage other email addresses (pointless without the context of metasharing)

Create an API (depends on meta-sharing)

(maybe) use the PECL id3 php extension to fill in mp3 information, like source of the file, the recording date, etc etc
	(maybe) PECL id3 is here: http://pecl.php.net/package/id3 and the tutorial is at http://devzone.zend.com/article/4025
	

(maybe) record incoming provide a phone forward service for medical purposes. This would allow the patient to give the doctor a special "record my doctor" phone number that they could use for all medical related calls. The number would automatically record all the information sent to through to the cell phone... 

(maybe) implement a version of record incoming for general purpose call recording. So that you could give out a special phonenumber to people who were not your friends that would automatically record everything. Some states require that both parties now about the call as per: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telephone_recording_laws#Two_party_notification_states
so for numbers in those states inbound and outbound calls would need to be done with a voice prefix that says, this call is being monitored...
